Modern communication over the internet is supported by the widely used TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol, package. But TCP/IP's built-in inefficiencies can cause bottlenecks, especially in busy or latency-rich networks. The paper explores less-discussed TCP/IP bottlenecks, with a particular emphasis on the stateful aspect of TCP, Long Round-Trip Time (RTT) with bufferbloat, and Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking. To overcome these constraints, we provide advanced methods that make use of breakthroughs in machine learning and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Among our suggested remedies are an SDN-integrated network optimization framework, an application-aware congestion control system, and a dynamic congestion management system driven by machine learning. Our results demonstrate how cutting-edge methods can enhance TCP/IP and open the door to more dependable and effective network communication.
